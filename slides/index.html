            <p>Threading in Ruby comes in two basic flavors -- those VMs that have a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and those that don't.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>MRI 1.8x - N Ruby VM threads GIL'd to 1 OS thread</li>
              <li>MRI 1.9x - N Ruby VM threads GIL'd to N OS threads</li>
              <li>JRuby and Rubinius (2.0+) - VM threads correspond directly to OS threads</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>All Ruby implementations have Thread - maybe for a reason?</li>
              <li>Ruby switches to another thread if IO would block b/c it's idle</li>
              <li>Extra processes can complicate stuff enormously</li>
              <li>New processes are *cheap*? Maybe on AWS.  Not on ARM.</li>
              <li>Rails has been threadsafe since 2008 - maybe for a reason?</li>

            <h2>Places you *have* to use threads</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>A console app that does things in the background (e.g. Metasploit console)</li>
              <li>A GUI app that does anything at all</li>
              <li>Speeding up collections of network interactions in one process</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              There are lots of places you'll want to be able to do mroe than one thing at once.  I made an iPhone game one time and just having music in the backgroun meant - you guessed it - a separate thread.  Lots of us spend a lot of time programing for the web, which has a built-in concurrency primitive in the request.  This creates myopia IMO.

            <h2>Celluloid</h2>
            <h3>Easier concurrency with the actor pattern</h3>
            <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts</a></small>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What's "actor" mean?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Entities in computation are "actors" which can send, receive, and act on messages</li>
              <li>Each actor does its own thing - there's no assumed sequence of interactions</li>
              <li>...so there's nothing keeping actor tasks from happening in parallel</li>
              <li>in fact, you *assume* asynchronicity and program for it</li>
              <li>ALL communications happen via messages. No shared state between actors.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              * Shared state is eliminated in this model
              * This means one of the biggest headaches in concurrent programming is eliminated
              * Go's philosophy on this is the most elegant sum-up: "don't communicate by sharing memory - share memory by communicating"

            <h2>In their own words...</h2>
            <blockquote>
              Much of the difficulty with building concurrent programs in Ruby arises because the object-oriented mechanisms for structuring code, such as classes and inheritance, are separate from the concurrency mechanisms, such as threads and locks. Celluloid combines these into a single structure, an active object running within a thread, called an "actor", or in Celluloid vernacular, a "cell".

            <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Concurrency with just threads and mutexes *is* hard</li>
              <li>And error prone</li>
              <li>And notoriously hard to get right</li>

            <h2>Celluloid builds on popular foundations</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Erlang's concurrency is based on the actor model/pattern</li>
              <li>This kind of thing is getting more and more common in languages</li>

            <h3>Celluloid example: futures</h3>

              <code>class Hasher
  include Celluloid

  def initialize(secret)
    @hash = Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(secret)
  end

  def add(data, n = 100000)
    string = @hash + data
    n.times { string = Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(string) }
    @hash = string
  end
end</code>
            </pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              * including Celluloid does lots of interesting stuff - ex: overrides "new" and creates a thread per actor instance
              * We do a non-trivial computation in Hasher#add
              * We will use the "future" method in Celluloid to get an asynch'ly computed value

          <h2>A modest suggestion</h2>
          <h3>We should all get better at concurrency</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn lang/framework for its concurrency paradigm (Celluloid, Go)</li>
            <li>Play around with threads and find out how they work</li>
            <li>Learn to debug multi-threaded code</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            * I'm working on learning Go, which I highly, highly recommend.
